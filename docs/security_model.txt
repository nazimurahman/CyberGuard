CYBERGUARD SECURITY MODEL

SECURITY PRINCIPLES
1. DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH
   • Multiple security layers prevent single-point failures
   • Each agent provides independent security perspective
   • Coordinated defense through mHC prevents bypass

   • Never trust, always verify all components
   • Mutual TLS between all internal services
   • Continuous authentication and authorization
   • Microsegmentation of agent communication

3. PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN
